This is a recreation of the classic Frogger game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to move the frog from the bottom row to the top row of the game board, while avoiding obstacles such as cars and logs. The frog can move up, down, left, and right, but must avoid colliding with any obstacles, or else the game will be over.

To start the game, click the "Start/Pause Game" button. The timer on the top left corner will begin counting down from 30 seconds, and the player has to reach the top row before the time runs out. The score is displayed on the top right corner of the screen, and increases with each successful row the frog reaches.

## How to Run the Game

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game should load and be ready to play.

## Files and Folders

The game is composed of the following files and folders:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game board and interface.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the appearance of the game elements.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that controls the game mechanics and behavior.
- `photo.avif`: Background image.
